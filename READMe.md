# Setup in QT

Requires [QMake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmake-manual.html) and [QTCreator](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer).

QMake should generally already be on your system if you have QTCreator.

QT Creator should allow you to create your own build files with QMake when you try to open the .pro file.
